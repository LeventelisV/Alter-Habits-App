## Name

Alter Habits (Front end)

## Description

Alter Habits idea was basically to create an application for people who are bored of the gym or do not want to engage exclusively in any sporting activity but still want to take part on them. They should have the opportunity to pick among various sporting activities (e.g. dance, football, karate...)  without having to only participate to one of them, or have to pay a full subscription to each one of them. Based on that idea Alter Habits provides users with a number of appointments (based on a subscription) available to use in a variety of sports and activities shown in the application.
